<h1>This is a page about Me!</h1>
<ul>
<li>Hello, I'm Adam. I'm sixteen years old and a junior at eAchieve Academy.</li>
<li>I have an older sister, Ava, who just graduated from eAchieve this past year, and a younger brother, Alex, who is just starting eAchieve as a freshman this year.</li>
<li>In my free time I like to play basketball, play video games, play piano, take care of my guinea pig, and watch Wisconsin sports.</li>
<li>I don't really watch TV or movies very often, but I'll listen to all types of music.</li>
<li>My goals for this school year are to get straight A's, pass my two AP exams, and get a good ACT score.</li>
</ul>
